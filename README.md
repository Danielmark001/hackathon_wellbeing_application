Fostering sleep and raising awareness about the importance of rest through AI

## Getting Started

In our pursuit of excellence, we recognise the need to constantly evaluate and improve the wellbeing of our community members. We understand that by fostering a culture of wellness, we can empower individuals to achieve their full potential, both academically/at work, and personally. 

We developed an application that fosters sleep through Gamification, AI Calendar, and many more. Through this app, it customs your own schedule and gives reminders on important activities for promoting sleep, such as eating nutritious food, taking a stretch and exercise, as well as breaks between study/work schedule.

Currently the application has been published to the Google Play Store, although the app is still in development. We plan on expanding on the personal journaling and gamification style of the application. The AI model has not been finalized yet. It is now available in 2 languages: English and Chinese (simplified).

The link for the application in Google Play App Store can be accessed here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.health.ai 

The new version 3.0.0 is currently in review and waiting for full rollout, and has been deployed to 17 countries in the world. While there are some difficulties in trying to integrate NTULearn to our application, we can have other alternatives such as using Google Calendar into our application, where push notifications are displayed in mobile phones as well.
