Fostering sleep and raising awareness about the importance of rest through AI

## Getting Started

In our pursuit of excellence, we recognise the need to constantly evaluate and improve the wellbeing of our community members. We understand that by fostering a culture of wellness, we can empower individuals to achieve their full potential, both academically/at work, and personally. 

We developed an application that fosters sleep through Gamification, AI Calendar, and many more. Through this app, it customs your own schedule and gives reminders on important activities for promoting sleep, such as eating nutritious food, taking a stretch and exercise, as well as breaks between study/work schedule.
